-------------------------
add benchmark to find out tabu size, starting temperature

-> it should reveale the percentage of planning entities, which we can 
dynamically set during solving


------------------------------------
each machine will have number of free executors

ideas:
-pool with all nodes has to be contructed at the beginning and with every update
-planningEntityProperty will be changed to planningSolutionProperty
-new hard constraint has to be included - to avoid assignment of wrong machine
-moves has to be fixed; on the other hand, maybe generic moves would be usable... -> pillarSwapMove


-the comparison assignment (FIFO) must be improved or deleted...
-input generation must be updated
------------------------------------
questions:
-can every job be assigned to executor on machine where another job is running? (port collision)
-parent jobs probably can?

answers:
-more jobs on the same slave --> only special slaves have several executors 
    and user must be aware of port collision when he gives this label to his job.
-ordinary slave has only 1 executor; 0-1 free at every moment.
