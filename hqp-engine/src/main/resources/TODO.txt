-------------------------
add benchmark to find out tabu size, starting temperature

-> it should reveale the percentage of planning entities, which we can 
dynamically set during solving


------------------------------------
each machine will have number of free executors

ideas:

-pool with all nodes has to be constructed at the beginning --finished

-merging the jobs and machine and executors --finished

-planningEntityProperty will be changed to planningSolutionProperty --finished

-new hard constraint has to be included - to avoid assignment of wrong machine --finished

-moves has to be fixed; on the other hand, maybe generic moves would be usable... -> pillarSwapMove --finished

-the comparison assignment (FIFO) must be improved or deleted...--finished

-input generation must be updated --finished

-fix json input & output --finished

-set config back to previous values --finished
------------------------------------
questions:
-can every job be assigned to executor on machine where another job is running? (port collision)
-parent jobs probably can?

answers:
-more jobs on the same slave --> only special slaves have several executors 
    and user must be aware of port collision when he gives this label to his job.
-ordinary slave has only 1 executor; 0-1 free at every moment.
